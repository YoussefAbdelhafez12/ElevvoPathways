Task 1: I analyzed sales data to create a comprehensive dashboard. My work involved data cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.

I used Excel to build interactive pivot tables and a dashboard, which included:

A total sales figure.

Charts visualizing sales by region, product category, ship mode, and customer segment.

A chart showing monthly sales over time.



Task 2: I used Python to analyze the Titanic dataset, focusing on survival factors.

I cleaned the data by filling in missing values for age and location of embarkation.

I performed exploratory analysis to understand the data, including survival rates by gender.

I created visualizations like a bar chart to show survival by gender and a heatmap to show feature correlations.



Task 3: Retail Data Analysis with Python

I used Python (pandas and matplotlib) to analyze a retail sales dataset. My work included:

Data Cleaning and Calculation: I cleaned the data and calculated total sales for each transaction.

Trend Analysis: I created a time-series analysis to visualize monthly sales trends and used moving averages to identify underlying patterns.

Performance Breakdown: I broke down sales performance by country and product, identifying the top-performing countries and the top 10 best-selling products.



Task 4: used a business intelligence tool (Power BI) to create a Retail Insights dashboard. My responsibilities included:

KPI Visualization: I designed the dashboard to display key performance indicators (KPIs), including total sales and profit.

Data Visualization: I created a treemap chart to visualize the distribution of sales across different regions (West, East, Central, and South).
